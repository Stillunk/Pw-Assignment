The variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared deviations, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions. However, the covariance is not standardized and can take on any value, which makes it difficult to compare covariances between different datasets or variables.\n",

    "In terms of measures of central tendency, outliers can significantly affect the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values, outliers can disproportionately influence the sum and thus the mean. For example, consider the following dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. The mean of this dataset is (1+2+3+4+5+10)/6 = 25/6 = 4.17. However, if we remove the outlier (10), the mean becomes (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3, which is significantly different.\n",

    "In terms of measures of dispersion, outliers can significantly affect the range, variance, and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset, so a single outlier can greatly increase the range. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation are both measures of how spread out the data is around the mean, so outliers can greatly increase these measures. For example, consider the following dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100. The range of this dataset is 99, the variance is 866, and the standard deviation is 29.43.
