    "A Cumulative Density Function (CDF) describes the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a given value. For example, in a fair six-sided die, the CDF would show the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to a specific value. CDFs are used to understand probabilities, compare distributions, calculate percentiles, and perform hypothesis testing.PDF describe the distribution only continuous random variable and PMF describe the distribution only discrete random variable, but CDF, that it can be defined for any kind of random variable (discrete, continuous, and mixed). Therefore we are using CDF\n",
